# Hash Visualizer

This writes a visual representation of a list of hashes to `stdout` for easier visual inspection.

## Usage

```
python visualizer.py
```

This will generate a visualization for all the hashes in
`res/hashes/testhashes` and write them to to the terminal at once.

If animation is desired, run the helper script:

```
./animate
```

This writes the hashes to stdout sucessively while clearing the screen
intermittently.
